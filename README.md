# EventLinkQR
CMPUT 301 Group Project: An Event Check-In System with QR code scanning.

## Running the app
In order to fully test the app, you will need:
- Maps API key.
  - This goes in local.properties with the format `MAPS_API_KEY=.....`
  - A member of the group will share this with trusted people who need it (TA, proff, etc...)
  - This is the restricted file that you will need to be granted access to: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eCfYxXtamlEcBtx8ANlv6Ah68maKh7L0V6MWnA2mLrY/edit?usp=sharing

## Documentation
The wiki is where you will find links to documentation such as UML, UI Mockups, Story Board, and more! New documentation should also go in the `doc/` folder.

## Backlog
See the Github project for a view of User Stories and the tasks associated with them. Issues marked with "story" tag have the requirements and acceptance criteria, while those marked as "task" reflect logical chunks of work that complete the user story. Tasks are linked to user stories,

Feel free to log bugs with the "bug" tag and these will be picked up ASAP. 

## Roadmap
In Part 4 we will take on:
- Admin functionality
- Any outstanding Organizer / Attendee functionality
- UI improvments to align with our new mockups and address suggestions from TA
- Other potential improvements
